* LFE

Here we will discuss or plans related to LFE and its tooling. Mainly we will
concentrate on Emacs.

** Plans
*** Emacs
**** finding documentation
We can look up some Erlang documentation and the Hyperspec based on model,
function name and arity.

**** autocompletion
We have a hard coded list of functions and are able to filter the entries based
on a substring.

**** talking to LFE
+ discussed on Slack
+ idris-mode example
+ possibility of digging though beam files
+ check lfex
***** my plan
+ find way to query LFE for loaded modules
+ then query the module for defined functions

*** Rebar3 integration
At the moment I would rather start an Erlang project and add lfe files as
dependencies.
